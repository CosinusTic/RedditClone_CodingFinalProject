# Welcome
Welcome to the backend side of the reBBit prject.

## Description
This projects serves as an API for the front end version in VUE for the yowl project. It contains models that are linked to a local mysql database, controllers that interact with this data, as well as routes that enables the front end to interact with the API and unitary tests which were implemented to test that basic functionalities work.

## Launch the backend 
- Make sure to be connected to local mysql socket: "mysql -u username -p" then enter your password
    -> In case the mysql service is not active, use "sudo service mysql restart" or "sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart"
- To launch the server, use "php artisan serve", make sure composer is up to date with "composer update" in your project directory

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.
